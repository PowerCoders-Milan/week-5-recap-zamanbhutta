# Website with flexbox

We want to create a website with header, main and footer.

- Create the header with any background color and a title
- Create the main with 3 boxes, in the same line (with flexbox), with even space between them all. Give them 3 different colors.
- Create a footer that will stay at the bottom of the page.

Before starting to write HTML and CSS draw the schema of the website on a piece of paper to have your plan.
