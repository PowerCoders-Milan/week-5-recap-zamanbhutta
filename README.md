# Week5 Recap Day

Today we will recap HTML and CSS, JS basic syntax and the DOM.

Make sure to finish ex 1 & 2 of every section.

I suggest to do the exercises in this way:
1. CSS
2. JS
3. DOM

The exercises are divided like this:
- The first two of every section are the most important ones
- The third is a bit more advanced
- The fourth (Extra) is only to be done when all the others are done (or in the weekend)

Please read carefully, review the slides and the concepts before starting to write.

**Rewrite the instructions** and ask if they aren't clear, **write pseudocode** then start coding.

**When in doubt test everything:**
- Run the localhost and inspect
- Console log the variable or element
- Review the syntax
